- Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.
- Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
- Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
             Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them.
